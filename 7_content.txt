	In this course we will set a google maps marker on drumul gazarului, Bucuresti, Romania.

	For this we will have a new activity, Maps template.

	In addition we will have to get an api key from GMaps. To make it easy
go to the fallowing site:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
	
	Once your api key is generated insert it in the google_maps_api. Android
generates it very well and it's easy to find where.

	All you have to do after is to start this new intent.
	Below you have the code for the app that starts at the button present on this page.
